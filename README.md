# Cloud Resume Challenge

Series of challenges, which deepen AWS knowledge and provide an opportunity to perform technical experience using AWS.
The main goal is to create and deploy the static website hosting a resume of the pretender.

The additional steps include integrating it with database, providing an API, using automation for building, testing and deploying the code and the infrastructure and many others.
Apart from standard objective, most of the steps include optional extensions recommendation. They are different from the core task and focus on practicing concrete set of skills in one of the specific areas.

The area of interest chosen by me to do those extensions if possible is **DevOps**.

## Benefits of the challenge

After completing the challenge, the practitioner is able to gain multiple skills, related (but not limited) to AWS ecosystem:

* Software Development (Frontend / Backend perspective)
* IaC (Infrastructure as Code) using CloudFormation, SAM, CDK
* CI/CD (AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodePipeline)
* Serverless Architecture on AWS (Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, S3)
* Security (IAM, bucket policies, API authentication/authorization)
* Networking (DNS if using Route53, ALB, Routing/IP traffic if creating own VPCs/subnets)
* many more
